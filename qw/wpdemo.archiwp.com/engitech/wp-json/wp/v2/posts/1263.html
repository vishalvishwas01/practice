Naturally, the appeal of mobile apps for its market potential cannot fade away anytime soon, at least until another great technology can replace mobile apps. But surprisingly, only a handful of apps in every niche really become successful and only a handful of apps across all niches really <span class=\"text-primary\">make it a phenomenal success<\/span>. So, what about the failure of other apps? What are the key factors responsible for the failure of millions of apps?
